# Bootcamp Challenge 03: JavaScript - Password Generator

## Description

This project was created to help myself better understand basic JavaScript logic, flow, etc. A basic password generator was a great exercise in using arrays and string methods and logic. This password generator isn't entirely practical, as it is completely random and may generate a password of all the same character (albeit at an extremely low rate), but can be a great place to start. The best password practice would be following [this xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/936/). I learned how to better use arrays, strings, and methods to accomplish goals, such as concatenating a string of characters to randomly choose from.
